## Coding Conventions

Please stick yourself to following coding conventions while contributing to this project.

In Atom Editor you can install Linter (https://atom.io/packages/linter) to lint your code easily on the fly.
There are many linters for every programming language.
In our project we especially use Linter-jshint (https://atom.io/packages/linter-jshint) and
linter-pep8 (https://atom.io/packages/linter-pep8).
To use Linter-pep8 you also have to install pep8, e. g. via: `pip install --upgrade pep8`.
